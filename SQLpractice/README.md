# Data Analyst SQL Portfolio Project Repository

Welcome to my portfolio projects repository! This repository contains two projects that showcase my skills and interests in data analysis and research.

## COVID Cases Analysis Project
In this project, I followed along with a YouTube tutorial to analyze COVID-19 cases data. 
The tutorial helped me understand data manipulation and visualization techniques using SQL. You can find the tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/qfyynHBFOsM?si=75NTj2aa075-DOlk).

## Graduates Labour Market Project
This project represents my independent research on the labour market for graduates.
I collected, cleaned, and analyzed data related to employment outcomes, industries, and salaries of recent graduates. 

### Project Highlights:
- [x] Data collection from reliable sources.
- [ ] Cleaning and preprocessing of raw data.
- [x] In-depth analysis using SQL queries.
- [ ] Visualizations to present key findings.
- [ ] Insights into the dynamics of the labour market for graduates.

Feel free to explore the respective project folders for more details and code examples!
